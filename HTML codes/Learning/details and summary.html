        <p>
            We live in a God-gifted world, but humans are the reason behind the deterioration of the environment. Everything that surrounds us constitutes the environment. The earth is made up of various environments in which all living and non-living things coexist. Nature’s biological, physical and natural forces interact to generate conditions that allow creatures to survive. The environment is a term used to describe such circumstances. A derivative of the word environment is the French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround.’ The environment is made up of all biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) things. Plants, animals, human beings, and insects are examples of biotic components. They are classified as biological environmental components. Every living thing has a predetermined life cycle. The human being, for example, is the most powerful living entity on the planet. To meet his needs, he requires plants and animals. Without these components, the life of human beings will be disordered. The atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are all examples of abiotic/physical components. The atmosphere is a gaseous layer containing nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. The hydrosphere is made up of all the water bodies, such as rivers and oceans. The lithosphere is the earth’s solid outer shell. It is composed of the crust, covering the earth’s mantle, rocks, and soil. The biosphere, where life exists, is the most essential layer. There are ecosystems in the water, on land, and in the air.
All of these species lives are predicated on their ongoing interaction with one another. Their functioning is organised by nature, and once spent, it might be eliminated. The destruction of the environment has now become a big issue that humans must address.

        <p>
            Environment is all the living and non-living things occurring naturally on the earth like sunlight, forests, animals, plants, air, water, land and everything surrounding us. It can also be defined as social, biological, economical, physical and chemical factors surrounding us. Natural environment is created by nature like air, water, fossil fuels, soil etc. while manmade environment is created by humans i.e. housing, technology, transportation, infrastructure etc.

        <summary>HOW to Protect The Environment</summary>
        <p>
            Earth is a beautiful place to live in, with the most favorable environmental conditions for living beings. But we humans are making it vulnerable and are destroying our own homes with activities that are causing pollution at an increased rate. In this protecting the environment essay, 200 words will be explained properly on how to save the environment.

Environmental protection has become the need of the hour as it is getting destroyed each day. So, governments are making policies and are coming into agreements with other countries to come up with strategies that can protect the environment. Some companies also have the same aim of protecting the environment from the activities of humans.

In this short article on environmental protection, it is clear that if sudden steps are not taken then, our future generation will have to live in a polluted environment that is conserved very conserve difficult. Environmental protection is the key to a safe and secure future with a beautiful environment to live in.

            Concerns relating to pollution and the disposal of the large amount of ash from coal based power stations, which are the mainstay of India's power generation, are being addressed through strategies to promote environmentally sustainable power development.
    
    Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for Afforestation
    Fly Ash Utilisation Action Plan
    Initiatives for improving the environmental performance of coal based stations
    Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
    ISO 14001
    Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for Afforestation
    
    A Special Purpose Vehicle is being set up jointly by NTPC and other Central Power Sector Undertakings as a Registered Society to take up afforestation and environmental measures in order to reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The objectives of the Society shall be to:
    
    Undertake fruitful channelising of investments by members to increase the national forest cover.
    Identify suitable lands for afforestation for power projects of NTPC and other members through Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) which will coordinate with the State Forest Departments/District Rural Development Authority etc.
    Facilitate quick procurement of forest clearance for the forestland proposed to be acquired by NTPC and other members for the future projects to be set up.
    Interact with MOEF to score off the necessary compensatory afforestation required for projects of NTPC and other members, which needs diversion of forestland.
    It is noteworthy that NTPC has already planted over 1.45 crore trees, which is one of the biggest afforestation efforts in the country. In fact the ambient temperature around the Ramagundam Station of NTPC has come down by 30 Celsius due to the afforestation done by NTPC as revealed in a study by the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad.
    
    Fly Ash Utilisation Action Plan
    
    Coal / Lignite based Thermal Power Generation has been the backbone of power capacity addition in the country. Indian coal is of low grade with ash content of the order of 30-60 % in comparison to imported coals which have a low ash content of the order of 2-20%.  A large quantity of ash is, thus being generated at Coal / Lignite based Thermal Power Stations in the country, which not only requires a large area of precious land for its disposal but is also one of the sources of pollution of both air and water.
    All Coal / Lignite based Thermal Power are required to follow the Ministry of Environment, Forests (MoEF) Notifications on fly ash utilization to achieve 100% utilization of fly ash. Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has now issued a revised Notification on 31st December 2021 in supersession of earlier Notifications in order to widen the scope of ash utilization.
    CEA compiles annual report on Fly Ash Generation at Coal / Lignite based Thermal Power Stations and its utilization in the country. As per the CEA report, ash utilization during Year 2021-22:
    
    No. of Thermal Power Stations from which data have been received	200
    Installed capacity (Mega watts)	213620.5
    Coal Consumed (Million tons)	759.02
    Fly Ash Generation (Million tons)
    270.82
    Fly Ash Utilization (Million tons)	259.86
    Percentage Utilization (%)	95.95
    Percentage Average Ash Content (%)
    35.68
    In line with the MoEF&CC Notification dated 31.12.2021, Ministry of Power had issued an Advisory on 22.02.2022 for all Coal / Lignite based Thermal Power to dispose of the ash in a transparent manner.
    
    Initiatives for improving the environmental performance of coal based stations
    
    i. The monitoring of emissions by thermal power companies come under the purview of CPCB/SPCB. The emissions from thermal power plants is being monitored through online OCEMS portal of CPCB since 2017, for both central and state to keep a check on emission level from these power plants. However, Central Electricity Authority (CEA) compiles a CO2 database for all Grid connected Power stations in the country on annual basis and publish the same. The objective of this database is to establish authentic and consistent quantification of the CO2 emission baseline. The data of CO2 emission from Grid connected Power stations in Indian power sector of last five years is as under:
    
    [Absolute Emissions in Million tons CO2]
    
    2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22
    922.18	960.90	928.14	910.02	1,002.02
    ii. The Thermal Power Stations are required to meet the environmental pollution standard set by MoEF&CC /CPCB/ SPCB from time to time. MOEF&CC has notified new environmental norms on 7th December 2015 for thermal power plants  related to Particulate Matter (PM), SO2, NOx& Mercury emissions and also vide its notification dated 31.03.2021 had issued categorized thermal power plants in category A, B & C for compliance of new emission norms including provision of penalty for non-compliance. Further, MOEF&CC vide its notification dated 5th September 2022 has granted two year Extension to TPPs for compliance of SO2 emission norms
    
    iii. Many TPPs have already adopted use of efficient technologies i.e. from subcritical to supercritical and now using ultra-supercritical technology in order to improve efficiency, thereby reducing coal consumption and thereby reducing emissions. A total capacity of Supercritical and Ultra-supercritical units of 63170 MW (91 supercritical Units) and 1320 MW (2 ultra-supercritical units) have been commissioned till 13.03.2023.
    
    iv. The capacity of about 18,362.24 MW comprising 260 units of inefficient and old thermal power generation units has already been retired till 31.12.2022.
    
    v. Ministry of Power on 08.10.2021 has issued revised policy on Bio-mass Utilization for Power Generation through Co-firing in Coal based Power Plants to use 5-10% blend of biomass pellets made, primarily of agro-residue along with coal after assessing the technical feasibility viz. safety aspect etc.  
    
    vi. Thermal Power Plants of total capacity of about 181 GW is covered under Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) scheme and they are given mandatory targets to reduce their specific energy consumption i.e. Net Heat Rate (kcal/kwh). BEE is the nodal agency for implementing the  PAT scheme.
    
    vii. Carbon Capture, utilisation and Storage (CCUS): CCUS refers to suite of technologies, which will help to remove CO2 before it enters atmosphere. These technologies can play a diverse role in meeting global energy and climate goals. NTPC has taken up an R&D project to setup a 10 TPD Flue Gas CO2 to Methanol Plant  at NTPC Vindhyachal to capture the CO2 from waste flue gases to convert it into Methanol.
    
    
    Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
    
    To address increasing concerns related to the environment and to improve environmental performance, the services of Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) have been engaged for providing consultancy services to the Ministry of Power on CDM. The terms of reference include project formulation, base line surveys for each project, negotiations with the CDM parties, identification of the counterpart CDM parties from the developed countries, cost of CO2 monitoring and verification of CO2 emission reduction and supervision of project implementation.
    
    ISO 14001
    
    Established in November 1975 for nation's Sustainable Power Development, National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPC) is today India's largest power utility with an installed capacity of 21,749 MW (19% of India's installed capacity) contributing to 26% of total generation in the country, with high availability factor of its power plants. NTPC has plans to double its capacity. NTPC has recently diversified into the hydro sector and formed for joint venture companies for distribution, R&M, etc. Environment Management is a high priority area in the company and several Policies have been formulated to ensure generation of green power. Through persuasion of sound environmental management systems and practices , NTPC's 18 stations have been accredited with ISO:14001 certification. As a responsible corporate citizen, NTPC is a member of Global Compact a UN initiative for Corporate social responsibility.
    
    The focus and emphasis in future in the company will be on generation of power in line with global standards and in complete harmony with the environment and nature.

        <summary>Why environment is nessacary for human </summary>
        <p>
            Global warming is the rise in the temperature of the earth and atmosphere caused by the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has severe effects on our environment. The air, water and atmosphere are toxified due to the greenhouse gas effects. Rise in population, burning of fossil fuels, clearing forests, farming and destroying garbage are major causes of global warming.

Let us have a look at some severe impacts of global warming on our environment:

Global warming causes more frequent and severe heat waves that give rise to several health hazards for living species.
Many species are affected by the rise in temperature and we are also losing some of the species due to global warming. The range of species that depend on cooler weather will face withering habitats.
Since the past century sea levels have raised 6.7 inches due to global warming. Ocean Glaciers melt when the earth gets warmer causing sea levels to rise.
Global warming also causes rise in acidification of the oceans chemistry due to the effect of carbon dioxide in atmosphere reacting to salt water. This creates risk for the ocean species.
Natural calamities such as droughts and floods have become more common due to global warming.
Due to severe heat stokes and wildfires several trees on the mountain are dying.
More pressure on groundwater will rise due to droughts.
Thus, global warming is a serious problem exploiting our environment and has to be prevented. We need to protect our environment from getting damaged further and avoid activities that cause damage to environment. Planting more and more trees and protecting forests and reforestation should be encouraged. Educating people about population control is vital. It is important for us to save more and more energy and decrease the use of fuels.
